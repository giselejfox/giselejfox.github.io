My personal website to showcase projects

Personal reminders:
- work on the other branches (ex. v1/v2...) and *then* merge to main

General rules
1. Push changes on other branch
2. Switch to main `git checkout main`
3. Merge changes `git merge <branch-name>`
4. Run `npm run build`
5. Run `npm run deploy`
