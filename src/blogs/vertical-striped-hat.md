# I am making this vertical striped hat okey

I really love it, it's inspired by the crochet hats that I love dearly. However, it's actually really really hard to knit vertical stripes and not do colorwork. Some would say impossible. So I am going to make individual stripes (aka "petals" because they have thay sort of shape) and piece them together. This is also a better way for me to go about making projects since i like the feeling of small achievements along the way. It helps me move faster towards my end goal.

## Version 1
Unfortunately it didnt turn out quite as expected. It was definitely too big and created too much of a bunch around the top. 

What I liked:
- The colors involved and how they overall meshed together
- The seamless seams 
- The height of the folded brim

## Next steps

Modify the pattern so I alternate between long "petals" and short "petals". That way there isn't as much bunching at the top.
