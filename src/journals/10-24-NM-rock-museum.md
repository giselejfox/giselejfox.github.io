# Rock Rocks Rocks!!

On October 9th 2024 me and my family entered possibly my new favorite museum of all time: New Mexico Bureau of Geology Mineral Museum.

There was no admission fee, only few posters explaining the science, just cases abd cases of the most beautiful minerals and rocks you've ever seen in your entire life. The kicker? There were extremely resonably priced specimens at the front for you to sort through and eventually buy.

I got these rocks because one reminds me of a Georgia O'Keeffe painting and the other is one I'd like to stare at forever.
