# Amsterdam Musings from Summer 2022

In June and July of 2022 I spent a quarter studying the libraries, museums, and archives of Amsterdam. This was a program out of the University of Washington and the main deliverable was a blog series and a reflection. I'm glad I wrote them in markdown and can easily transfer them over to this new journal of mine!

## Greeting Amsterdam

![View from my writing perch in Sarphatipark](/img/journal/amsterdamArchive/park-view.JPG)

The first day in Amsterdam was a rough one. I took the overnight flight straight from Seattle which left Saturday the 18th at 1ish and arrived to Amsterdam the next day at 8am. That means that I should have slept the whole way to set my body on the right path but there was little to no sleep on the flight. However, some excitement did result from what would be an otherwise cramped and tiring experince. I ended up talking to the guy I sat next to on the flight! We started by doing a cross word together before the plane took off and chatting the whole last two hours. Shoutout to the wonderful conversationalist Michael from Issaquah! 

To set the scene post excitment: I'm standing at baggage claim with Riley and Teal (two other gals from the program) and even though it's 11pm Seattle time, it's 8am Amsterdam time and that means I have more than 12 hours to go before I'm supposed to be sleeping. This, no surprise to anyone, turned out to be a bad time. We made it to the hotel in record time but had to find a way to kill time before our rooms were ready so me and some other students headed out on a walk based on vibes. That meaning we just walked until a cross streets and turned onto the one that seemed the most interesting. We continued that walk with a pizza stop in the middle and ended in a thrift store where I jokingly asked a fellow vibe walker "Is it just me or is the floor moving" and turns out it was, in fact, me getting vertigo due to being awake for more than 24 hours. 

After that we headed back to the hotel to just sit down and Riley was kind enough to let me nap in her (twin) bed with her since my bed wasn't ready yet. Orientation started up after the solid 2 hour nap and we walked around the DePijp neighborhood with one of Trent's former students as she led us through her neighborhood.

Overall the first day was long, tiring, and yet incredibly exciting. It was real nice to be able to hang out with people in a communally tired situation. We didn't have to talk but when we did it was to help keep each other awake and sentient.

## Off to a Running Start

![The view from a 6am run](/img/journal/amsterdamArchive/run-view.JPG)

I got up the first day of the program at 5:30 and decided to call it a start. I ended up going for a run and because Amsterdam is so north it was broad daylight at 6:00am and completely empty, I got the city to myself! It was such a beautiful treat to be able to zip past all the amazing architecture and the hug the canals while downloading the google maps of the area to my noggin.

After breakfast we had lecture, all in the brekafast room of the small hotel that holds only us 23 students for the entirety of our program. It was fully discussion based, no powerpoint in sight and even though that held my attention and I felt more engaged than regular lecture I still found myself skecthing to keep the wiggles out.

![Sketches from lecture](/img/journal/amsterdamArchive/sketch-array.png)

After lecture I felt a little antsy so I rented a bike from dear Gerrit, the staff member who's worked at the hotel the longest, and set out for a ride! I just decided to find a place to eat on my way and it was a good idea in theory but turned out to be a little anxiety inducing. I was already antsy from the lecture and then I accidentally biked towards the city center and got caught up in a whole system of bike traffic I wasn't accustomed to. I finally made it to an outdoor cafe near Vondelpark and sat down with little to know knowledge of dutch restaurant etiquette. I stewed in uncertainty but learned pretty quickly that you have to flag someone down if you want to get service. The one thing that grounded me and pulled me out of my slump was starting to sketch my surroundings and take time to notice everything around me. The lunch was delicious and the waiter was incredibly nice to me about my drawing too!

I made it back in time to head to an opening dinner for everyone in the program. We ventured to the north of Amsterdam Centrum and elbowed our way onto the ferry to take us accross the water. The table reserved for us was long at the back of the restaurant and backed with a wall of plants that we all fawned over. Before the food got sent out I pulled out my notebook and was about to start up one of my favorite past times, drawing someone while they draw me at the same time, when I came up with something better. I wrote "draw the person in front of you" at the top of the page, drew a quick doodle of the person in front of me and then passed the pen and paper down the line. By the end of the night we had two tables worth of drawings and seemingly a hit on our hands as everyone kept on saying they couldn't draw and then putting down the cutest drawing known to man. It turned out to be a great way to bring people together and give people something to do during a long introductory dinner.

![Everyone's sketches from the first dinner](/img/journal/amsterdamArchive/face-sketch.png)

The best feeling was that at the end of the day, when I was back in the hotel room absolutely exhausted from a full day out, all I wanted to do was the readings for the next day. All I wanted to do was relax and read about innovation in public policy because I couldn't wait to start the day over again and be able to contribute to the discussion in lecture yet again.

## It's Okay to Be Outside in Amsterdam

![The view from a local cafe](/img/journal/amsterdamArchive/cafe-view.JPG)

The biggest culture difference I've noticed in my first week of Amsterdam is that it's okay to be outside.

For the duration of the 4 week program we're staying in DePijp, a part of Amsterdam known for it's street market, cute cafes, and beautiful park. The biggest aspect, or lack thereof, that catches my attention when I walk around the neighborhood is the amount of sound travelling through the air. There isn't much. 

Back home in Seattle I live near a major throughway and there's always noise coming at me. It berates me through the air out in my yard, through the windows to my room, and even shakes the floor when big trucks go flying by. I can't escape the commotion anytime I go down a street and I often find myself frazzled by the outside, just hoping to get some quiter time when I close my door. The only calmness I can find is in the parks when the trees absord all the excess motion but when an airplane flies overhead the quietness breaks even there. 

Not only does the noise make the outside uninviting but the public planning doesn't help either. Public space seem to be only suited for transportating yourself from one place to the next with few spots to comfortably sit down and relax. In order to sit down at restaurant outdoor seating you need to buy a full meal, a day at a park seems like a once in a while adventure, and it's not like you want to sit down next to a busy road anyways.

Here I feel different. I feel peaceful being outside. The city is built for people to walk, for people to bike, and for trams to come through. Cars seem to be an afterthought as they struggle to push through the crowds of people and bikes whizzing around. There are still cars on the street every once in a while, there's still hustle and bustle as people go about but it's not as industrial or seperated from reality. Everyone walking outside seems to be at ease and comfortable within themselves and being around other people. The outside is meant for people to take up space and share. It isn't a big deal to hang out in a park, it's a normal part of everyday life.

Even the cafes here are inviting and meant for people to take as long as they need. They're built for people to come with their friends and just take a couple hours to themselves as they chat. People are there reading books, people are there just to eat, it's as if the outside can be as comfortable and familiar as your own living room.

Since I've been here I've been living in a tiny room with another student that can just barely hold two twin sized beds but I haven't yet felt cramped. In reality I'm hardly in the room, I'm always outside maybe doing work in the breakfast nook on the ground floor or at a cafe nearby, or out exploring the city by foot or bike. The world seems so safe here and I'm not relegated to the indoors, or *my* indoors specifically, in order to feel recharged or at peace. It's made me more open to the idea of living in microstudio situation or with a bunch of other *respectful* people (as I am now) and then just using the outside equally as my own space. That's a reality I could see myself living in Amsterdam.

## Intentional Design in Museums Connecting Past to Present

The first day of our program we sat down in the breakfast nook of our hotel to discuss what were seemingly simple questions: what is a museum, what is a library, and what is an archive.

My group was assigned the museum question and we came up with a couple boundaries for what defines a museum. In general it's more public than an archive, a place that can usually only be accessed by professionals in the field, and more private than a library since people can't take the items on display home. We figured a museum is a curated portion of a larger collection and it's meant to be viewed by the public. It usually hosues physical objects and is designed in a way to be an informative and educational experience for the observer. 

Even though the museums have the static element of the artwork or other phyisical objects they have on display, the elements of design around them are malleable and able to be intentionally changed in order to convey a certain narrative. From the information they include on the placcards to the placement and lighting of the space and deciding what to emphasize, museums have a lot of information and design choices that have a big impact on the takeaways the visitors have to the space.

With that question in mind I had a new perspective to the museums we visited our first week. It drove me to analyze the design of the museum and how the curators decided to display the items rather than just the content of the artwork or items themselves. How were they designing their museum to be educational? What narrative were they aiming for? What experience were they trying to achieve?

For example, on our tour in Den Haag we visited the Mauritshuis, a museum that displays some of the notable artworks like "The Girl with a Pearl Earring" and "The Anatomy Lesson of Dr Nicolaes Tulp". It's undeniable that these pieces of art are a staple in the art world and it's also undeniable that they're housed in the mansion built by John Maurice of Nassau who's wealth was sourced from enslaving people. So how did the museum go about trying to design an experience for the viewer with those two truths in mind?

The staff at Mauritshaus is open to trying to tie these art pieces from roughly the 17th century into how we think about and interact with the present. On their website they mention that their collection can be tied to the need of the Black Lives Matter movement today (without really explaining how) and the experience of coronavirus today (again without giving details as to how).

In particular they're hosting an exhibit called [Flashback](https://www.mauritshuis.nl/en/what-s-on/exhibitions/flashback/) where they collaborate with modern day photographers to bring some of the historical artwork into the present.

So, instead of just putting up the art as a spectacle to come and look at, the Mauritshaus is investing in exhibits that tie the past to the present but have a ways to go when actively explaining the context that some of the art resides in from the past.

It was also interesting to see the intentionality of design in the Anne Frank house, a museum that recetly went through a very large renovation and redesign. Most notably it changed from a design that centered a christian-type narrative (beginning, middle, triumphant end) to what would be considered a more jewish-type narrative (no end or "unsatisfying" end). It was also interesting to think about what kind of context the museum would have to account for now that World War II ended almost 80 years ago. Even 30 years ago it was more likely that the people coming in had first hand experience with World War II. Now it's not so likely. 

Not only can museums iterate their design to keep people engaged with the past 100s of years ago, but they have to keep their eye on the amount of knowledge people come into the space with especially when the experiences they're working with are swiftly turning from first hand experience to second and to third. 

So, if museums are inherently educational and are curated and designed experiences, they share a burden of contextualizing the art they house for the modern day. Art and historical items can be displayed for light education and entertainment but when it comes to culture heritage you have to accomodate your design to tie into and educate based on the currrent situation.

## OBA - Where the Library is High Value
Today my mind was absolutely blown away by OBA Oosterdok, the main central Amsterdam library located towards the north of the city. We spent a couple hours there hearing about the new projects they were implementing, how they get their funding, and then taking tours around different parts of their facility.

### Everything was designed to market a high value product: the books

![Fancy book lighting](/img/journal/amsterdamArchive/book-lighting.JPG)

The one thing that most notably seperates Dutch libraries from American libraries is that you have to pay to get into the Dutch libraries. It varies from who you talk to but it's generally costs around 60 euros a year for any citizen to have access to the library system. 

When we asked the librarian today about why they had a subscription system in place she immediately told us she thought it was a stupid practice and it should be free but went on to say that they do it because it's a bit of a culture thing in the Netherlands. The Dutch has a notion that if something's free then it's not worth using so they charge poeple so they feel like it's a worthwhile experience to have. I think this then started to bleed over to the design of the library so they made sure that the books and the space seemed special and high value so people would be more inclined to come.

It doesn't even look like a library, it looked like a beautiful bookstore mixed with bite sized pieces of museums. All the shelves are white with a moden finish and are well lit in a dramatic white light. There were also little exhibits scattered around that drew people in and encouraged them to read more books about the topics at hand, it elevated the whole experience to a whole other level.

![Gorgeous wooden shelves](/img/journal/amsterdamArchive/wood-book-shelves.JPG)

![Little library exhibit](/img/journal/amsterdamArchive/small-exhibit.JPG)

### It had an automated restocking system

This seemed to be more interesting to the MLIS (Masters of Library and Information Sciences) students who had experience working in a library than to me, a lowly undergraduate, but I'd be remiss if I didn't include it. After the books get dropped off at the book return booth on the ground floor, they get plopped onto a conveyor belt and automatically dropped off on the right floor they're supposed to be restocked at. An apparent marvel that blew everyone's mind.

![Other side of the conveyor belt book return](/img/journal/amsterdamArchive/book-conveyor.JPG)

### Even though it was modern and automated it was really homey

In the library area itself there were a ton of plants and comfy seating. It had the presence of a cozy bookstore and you didn't feel like you had to be quiet all the time while you were there. It wasn't one of those spaces where you immediately go quiet once you enter the space, you felt like you were entering a slightly more sophisticated public living room of sorts that was technically meant for getting work done. There was even a restaurant at the top (with a delicious variety of healthy and homey foods) and a cafe below that offered a darker and chicer starbucks-like seating area with any and all magazines displayed around for you to read.

![Real life plants all around](/img/journal/amsterdamArchive/plants-afar.JPG)

### They partnered with organizations around to curate book collections
One of the programs they had in place was one called the [House of all Languages](https://www.oba.nl/hvat.html) where one wall on two floors is dedicated to a books curated by different organizations around Amsterdam to help celebrate the different cultural groups in Amsterdam. The library asks the organizations to give them a list of books to show and no questions asked their beautiful shelf area will be stocked with all the books that that organization thinks their groups will enjoy and that other Dutch populations will be able to learn from.

### They had no problem with people **not** wanting books on the shelves 

![Drag King Exhibit](/img/journal/amsterdamArchive/drag-king-exhibit.JPG)

Another question that got brought up to the librarians in our talks was: "what do you do when people don't want certain books on the shelves?". 

We were met with earnest confusion, "...what do you mean? I dont understand". And then we quickly realized that there is absolutely no problem with that in the Netherlands. There's no question about whether books with queer or non-queer intimacy can stay on the shelves, there's no fight about what's appropriate or not appropriate to share with kids. People are welcome to learn about what they want to learn about and it's not on the librarians to try and regulate the information the public has access to.

The figure above shows a small exhibit in the LGBT section on the history of drag kings in the netherlands. Something that seems so casual yet would be up for debate in most cities back in the US.

I was talking with it with some of the classmates during lunch afterwards and one even mentioned that they don't want to go back to be a librarian in their home town of Idaho because now a librarian can be jailed up to five 5 years if the community decides that what's on the shelf isn't appropriate. 

### All in all...

The library was beautiful, it seemed like an incredible feat of public space, and I hope some really cool and functional cross pollination occurs to help bring some of these ideas back to the US to help out our public spaces.

## What Would a Museum look like without Objects?

Over the course of the last week we went to 2 different ethnographic museums, the Museum Vulkenkunde in Leiden and the Tropen Museum in Amsterdam. The conversations that we had afterwards brought up questions of cultural object restitution and whether or not we should have ethnographic museums in general anymore. Below I'll discuss some of the differences I've noticed between the two and the effects each had on us as viewers.

> **Ethnography:** the scientific description of peoples and cultures with their customs, habits, and mutual differences. - Oxford Languages

Right off the bat it's easy to say that we as a group did not enjoy the Museum Vulkenkunde in Leiden. Most of the objects were supposed to be used in various religious ceremonies and most if not all were aqcuired during colonial periods where consent for these items to be stolen and displayed wasn't held in high regard. The biggest touch point for me was that the displays didn't feel educational but it felt more like a display of power. There were cases and cases of cultural artifacts that lived in sterile cases and only a fraction actually had placcards with rich details on the contents within. All they seemed to do was blatently display objects in all the same light in what could easily be compared to a trophy case. It seemed like the museum just wanted us to be impressed at all the objects it held from other cultures. 

The low dramatic lighting highlighting the objects on clear and unfriendly glass displays not only gave off a monotonous impression but it made the act of looking at everything tiring. All you could do was move from case to case looking at the beautiful details of each item but that gets tiring fast. There was no element added to keep our attention engaged, no trying to take us through an experience, just putting things from other cultures on display for us to gawk at. It was obviously a colonialist view of how white people saw the rest of the world.

Their use of space and displaying things higher and lower seemed to be at odds with an equal type of display. For example, they placed an exhibit of African relics on the floor which meant it resulted in a landscape of mostly white visitors peering down at them.

The Tropen Museum, however, had a different approach. The Tropen Musuem is a colonial cultural heritage museum, definitely a hard subject to broach and a hard experience to get right. We were definitely skeptical going into this one after we all had some bones to pick with the Vulkenkunde museum just two days earlier. This one still had objects of other cultures displayed but the general experience was so much better. First of all the objects weren't on display just to be on display, they were on display to help tell a story. Each little case was carefully curated to help lead the viewer through the years from both the perspective of the Dutch and heavily centering the experiences of the cultures that were on the opposite end of the dutch colonial experience.

The first example that stood out to me was the case that showed off an Indonesian puppet that depicted a European colonist. In the placcard they not only talk about the materials and the time period it was made but it also put the puppet into the perspective of the people that made it. They pointed out that the large nose and beard that the puppet depicting the European had were also features that the artists commonly used to depict devils. 

In the Tropen museum there was also some obvious dedication to how the displays were designed for the viewer. In the slavery section, they took 3 photos of enslaved people that were taken at a slave auction, blurred out the photo from the chest down, turned it black and white, and set the portraits up high so the viewers would be looking up at the photos. They hoped that this spacing and design choices gave the people in the photos dignity since they still wanted to display the photos to show that human people were trafficked and enslaved. It's still unnerving to have those images displayed since the people in the photos obviously couldn't give consent for their topless photos to be on display in a famous museum for the eyes of thousands of viewers coming through.

### So what can we do?
The question that then comes up is how do you build an ethnographic museum without exploiting or detaining other culture's products? We came up with the following idea that I thought was really neat:

Do away with the cultural and religious objects on display and turn the ethnography museum into an art museum where artists of the current day can come in and tell in their stories. As said beautifully by Maina, another student in the program, the best way to learn about other cultures is to talk to people of that culture, you aren't going to learn about the culutres by looking at their cupboards
