# Open Hand

Something I've enjoyed recently is an open hand as a signal accross the body.

I found one in [this tiktok dance](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTNnvjBpC/) where halfway through the dance she covers her face with a splayed palm facing outwards and continues to dance normally with the rest of her body. I don't know why the anonymity in the midst of it gets me. Covering someone's face changes the entire mood. The entire atmosphere.
